# BusyButton

This widget is a button that displays a spinner when busy is true.

`BusyButton` is intrinsically a `button` element and accepts all of its attributes.

## Usage

```jsx
import { BusyButton } from "react-simple-widgets/dist/busy-button";

<BusyButton busy invert>
  Click Me!
</BusyButton>;
```

- `busy?: boolean = false`

  If set to `true`, the button is disabled and a spinner icon is displayed within it

- `invert?: boolean = false`

  If set to `true`, the loader will use an inverted color scheme
