# ObjectView

This widget renders properties of an object in a table. 

`ObjectView` is intrinsically a `table` and it accepts all of its attributes.

## Usage

```jsx
import { ObjectView } from "react-simple-widgets/dist/object-view";

<ObjectView object props split />;
```

- `object: any`

  The object to render in the widget

- `props: Array<[string, ObjectViewCellResolver]>`

  The properties to display as columns for each list item. This is a two or three element array which
  of is composed of `[label, Cell resolver]`.

  - The 1st element is the **label** which is displayed as the column header

  - The 2nd element is the **cell resolver**. `ObjectView` uses this to display a cell value for a particular column of each item rendered. Cell resolver can be one of the following:
    - **Simple String**: (E.g. `property`) For each item, the cell value is `item.property`.
    - **Dot Separated String**: (E.g. `nested.value`) For each item, the cell value is `item.nested.value`.
    - **Function**: (E.g. `(item, itemIndex) => JSX.Element`) For each item, the function is called with the item and it's index. The returned JSX is then rendered in the cell.

- `split?: number = 0.35`

  The width ratio of the label column to the value column. It ranges from 0 to 1
