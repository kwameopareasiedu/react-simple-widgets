# Loader

Loader is a widget that displays a spinner. Since it is intrinsically a span, it accepts all
attributes of a `<span/>` tag

## Usage

```jsx
import { Loader } from "react-simple-widgets";

<Loader />
```

or

```jsx
import { Loader } from "react-simple-widgets";

<Loader>Hello world</Loader>
```
