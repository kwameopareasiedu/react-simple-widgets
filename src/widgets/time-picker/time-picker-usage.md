This widget allows you to select a time. `TimePicker` is intrinsically a `div` element and accepts all of its attributes.

import { TimePicker } from "react-simple-widgets";

<TimePicker value={value} onChange={onTimeChange} />;
```

- `value: string`

  The selected date of the widget in the format `HH:mm`. (E.g. 16:35)

- `onChange: (time: string) => void`

  This function is called with the selected time when the time changes. The time is in the format `HH:mm`.
