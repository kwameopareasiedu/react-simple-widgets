# useWindowBreakpoints

This is a React [hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that allow your app to be aware of the current window width category. The categories are computed using [Bootstrap's breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/breakpoints/#available-breakpoints)

## Usage

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useWindowBreakpoints } from "react-simple-widgets";

export function WindowBreakpointsUsage() {
  const { xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl, width } = useWindowBreakpoints();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Window width category has changed
  }, [xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl, width]);

  return null;
}
```

- `xs: boolean`

  Indicates the window width is **extra-small** (less than 576px)

- `sm: boolean`

  Indicates the window width is **small** (Between 576px and 768px)

- `md: boolean`

  Indicates the window width is **medium** (Between 768px and 992px)

- `lg: boolean`

  Indicates the window width is **large** (Between 992px and 1200px)

- `xl: boolean`

  Indicates the window width is **extra-large** (Between 1200px and 1400px)

- `xxl: boolean`

  Indicates the window width is **extra-extra-large** (Above 1400px)

- `width: number`

  The current `innerWidth` of the window
